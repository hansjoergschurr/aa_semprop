\section{Problem Description}
\label{problemdesc}
This report summarizes the result of project work done for the lecture ``Abstract Argumentation'' at TU~Wien by
Stefan Woltran. The goal of the project was to empiricaly evaluate certain properties of the extensions of a set
of argumentation frameworks.

Section~\ref{problemdesc} outlines the concept of argumentation frameworks, and extensions. Subsequently
the terms Rejected Arguments and Implicit Conflicts are defined.

Section~\ref{tools} presents the two tool that
were developed for this project. A detailed instruction on how to compile the programs, and their
command line arguments is given.

The following section describes the empirical evaluation. First the set of frameworks is described.
Some frameworks were generated with the help of a benchmark generator, some of them were selected
from the ICCMA'15 benchmark set. Secondly the results are presented.

Finnaly section~\ref{conclusion} concludes this report with some final remarks.

\subsection{Abstract Argumentation}

Abstract Argumentation were introduced by Dung in 1995 \cite{dung95}. The definitions given
here follow \cite{linsbichler2015hidden}.
